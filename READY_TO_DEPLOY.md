## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps

### Option A: Deploy to Render (Free, Easiest)

**Step 1**: Push to GitHub
```bash
cd /Users/haykkesh/Desktop/Projects/shape-tool-uploader
./deploy-to-render.sh
```

Then create a GitHub repo and push:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shape-tool-uploader.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Step 2**: Deploy on Render
1. Go to https://render.com and sign up (free)
2. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Render will auto-detect the `render.yaml` configuration
5. Click "Create Web Service"

**Step 3**: Share!
Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

---

### Option B: Deploy to Railway

1. Push to GitHub (same as above)
2. Go to https://railway.app
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway auto-detects and deploys!

Your app: `https://your-app.railway.app`

---

### Option C: Deploy to Fly.io

```bash
# Install Fly CLI
brew install flyctl

# Login
flyctl auth login

# Deploy
cd /Users/haykkesh/Desktop/Projects/shape-tool-uploader
flyctl launch

# Follow prompts, then your app is live!
```

Your app: `https://your-app.fly.dev`

## 🎯 What Happens on Deployment

1. **Build Phase**:
   - Platform runs `npm install`
   - Runs `npm run build` (compiles TypeScript → JavaScript)
   - Creates `dist/` folder with compiled code

2. **Start Phase**:
   - Platform runs `npm start`
   - Starts server on dynamic PORT
   - App becomes accessible via HTTPS

3. **Access**:
   - Your app gets a public URL
   - Share it with anyone to test!

---

## 📝 Environment Variables

The app automatically uses:
- `PORT` - Set by platform (no action needed)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production" on deployment

You don't need to configure anything!

## 💡 Features Ready for Deployment

- ✅ Armenian transliteration working
- ✅ Cyrillic transliteration working
- ✅ SVG upload and processing
- ✅ Dimension calculation
- ✅ Copy to clipboard functionality
- ✅ Download generated files
- ✅ Beautiful responsive UI

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations:
- **Render**: Sleeps after 15 min of inactivity (wakes in ~30s on first request)
- **Railway**: $5/month credits (can run out with heavy use)
- **Fly.io**: 3 VMs free (requires credit card but won't charge)

### File Storage:
- Generated files are temporary on free hosting
- They're deleted when the app restarts
- Users should download files immediately

### Performance:
- First request after sleep: ~30 seconds
- Subsequent requests: Instant
- For always-on service: Upgrade to paid tier (~$7/month)

## 🔄 Updating Your Deployed App

After making changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update: your changes"
git push origin main
```

Platforms with auto-deploy (Render, Railway) will automatically redeploy in 2-3 minutes!
